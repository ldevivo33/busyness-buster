Coming soon...

** Back-End **
We will build a RESTful API integration using FASTAPI to get calendar JSONS which we can fetch for individual events over a period of time (Unsure if it will be next 1 day, previous day, previous week as I usually just schedule my days the night before then throughout the day ). Identify the endpoints and build proceessing ipeline to ensure smooth scraping of events to store in the database. Next steps will be to implement openAI API calls for AI analysis of the info.
